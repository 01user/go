{"name":"The /Open Source/ Data Science Masters","tagline":"Curriculum","body":"The Curriculum for learning Data Science, Open Source and at your fingertips.\r\n\r\n## The Internet is Your Oyster\r\n\r\nI didn't want to wait. I wanted to work on things I care about **now**. Why sleep through grad school lectures tomorrow when you can hack on interesting questions today?\r\n\r\n*See [My Curriculum](http://bit.ly/corthelldata)*\r\n\r\nWith Coursera, ebooks, stackoverflow, and github -- all free and open -- how can you afford not to take advantage of an open source education?\r\n\r\n## The Motivation\r\n\r\nWe need more Data Scientists.\r\n\r\n> ...by 2018 the United States will experience a shortage of 190,000 skilled data scientists, and 1.5 million managers and analysts capable of reaping actionable insights from the big data deluge.\r\n\r\n-- [McKinsey Report Highlights the Impending Data Scientist Shortage](http://blog.gopivotal.com/news-2/mckinsey-report-highlights-the-impending-data-scientist-shortage) 23 July 2013\r\n\r\n## An Academic Shortfall\r\n\r\nClassic academic conduits aren't providing Data Scientists -- this talent gap will be closed differently.\r\n\r\n> **Academic credentials are important but not necessary for high-quality data science.** The core aptitudes – curiosity, intellectual agility, statistical fluency, research stamina, scientific rigor, skeptical nature – that distinguish the best data scientists are widely distributed throughout the population.\r\n\r\n> We’re likely to see more uncredentialed, inexperienced individuals try their hands at data science, **bootstrapping their skills on the open-source ecosystem and using the diversity of modeling tools available.** Just as data-science platforms and tools are proliferating through the magic of open source, big data’s data-scientist pool will as well.\r\n\r\n> And there’s yet another trend that will alleviate any talent gap: the democratization of data science. While I agree wholeheartedly with Raden’s statement that “the crème-de-la-crème of data scientists will fill roles in academia, technology vendors, Wall Street, research and government,” I think he’s understating the extent to which **autodidacts – the self-taught, uncredentialed, data-passionate people – will come to play a significant role in many organizations’ data science initiatives.**\r\n\r\n-- James Kobielus, [Closing the Talent Gap](http://www.ibmbigdatahub.com/blog/data-scientist-closing-talent-gap) 17 Jan 2013\r\n\r\n## The Open Source Curriculum\r\n\r\n**[Start Here](http://datasciencemasters.org)**.\r\n\r\n## Contribute\r\n\r\nI'm not the expert -- please Share and Contribute. **It's Open Source**!\r\n\r\nFollow me on Twitter [@clarecorthell](http://twitter.com/clarecorthell)","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
